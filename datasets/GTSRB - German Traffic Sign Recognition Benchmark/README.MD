# Benchmark name

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark

## Description

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:

Single-image, multi-class classification problem
More than 40 classes
More than 50,000 images in total
Large, lifelike database

The details about the full GTSRB dataset and the results of the final competition that was held at IJCNN 2011 can be found in our paper "Man vs. Computer: Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms for Traffic Sign Recognition" that was accepted for publication in a Neural Networks Special Issue.

Please cite this paper when when using or referring to the GTSRB dataset.
